A Python package for managing Active Directory

**Note**: This project is unfinished.

I started this project mostly to learn more about Python and interacting with LDAP for managing
Active Directory. Coming from a good bit of experience with PowerShell I modeled this Python module
after the PowerShell cmdlets to manage Active Directory.

Many functions are complete, but many more are missing and/or incomplete.
